## What is it?

This extension is an authentication service for TYPO3 which extends the frontend and backend login process by strong
two-factor authentication.

## What does it do?

The two-factor authentication is provided by a TYPO3 users username and password combined with a OTP (one time
password) which is generated by a YubiKey (a physical USB-key)

A YubiKey enabled user has to enter his username, password and a OTP to login to TYPO3s backend and/or frontend.

More information about the YubiKey, Yubico and the YubiCloud OTP validation service can be found at http://www.yubico.com

## Documentation

You can find a detailed documentation in the Documentation folder of the TYPO3 extension.
